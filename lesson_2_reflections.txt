What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I need to initialize it in order to set it as a reposetry that has the version controlling infrustrcture to support the Git and its commands and in order to be able to use the git tools with it in the future. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is the waiting area for anything to be committed while the working directory represent the files that are beind edited after the latest commit.
